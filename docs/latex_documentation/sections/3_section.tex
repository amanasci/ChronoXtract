Here, we discuss the list of frequency domain features extracted by the ChronoXtract package. 
\subsection{Fourier Transform}
The Fourier Transform is a mathematical technique that transforms a time-domain signal into its frequency-domain representation. It decomposes a signal into its constituent frequencies, allowing us to analyze the frequency content of the signal. 
The Fourier Transform is widely used in various fields, including signal processing, image analysis, and data compression.

\begin{equation}
X(f) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x(t) e^{-j2\pi ft} dt
\end{equation}

Where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(X(f)\) is the Fourier Transform of the signal \(x(t)\)
    \item \(f\) is the frequency
    \item \(t\) is time
    \item \(j\) is the imaginary unit
    \item \(e\) is the base of the natural logarithm
    \item \(\pi\) is the mathematical constant pi
    \item \(dt\) is the differential element of time
\end{itemize}
The Fourier Transform can be computed using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm, which is an efficient way to calculate the Fourier Transform of a discrete signal. The FFT algorithm reduces the computational complexity from \(O(N^2)\) to \(O(N \log N)\), making it suitable for real-time applications.

FFT Algorithm:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Check if the length of the input sequence is a power of 2. If not, pad with zeros to the next power of 2.
    \item Base case: If the input sequence has length 1, its FFT is itself.
    \item Divide the input sequence into two subsequences:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Even-indexed elements: $x[0], x[2], x[4], \ldots$
            \item Odd-indexed elements: $x[1], x[3], x[5], \ldots$
        \end{enumerate}
    \item Recursively compute the FFT of the even-indexed subsequence.
    \item Recursively compute the FFT of the odd-indexed subsequence.
    \item Combine the results using the butterfly operation:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item For $k = 0$ to $N/2-1$:
                \begin{enumerate}
                    \item $X[k] = E[k] + e^{-j2\pi k/N} \cdot O[k]$
                    \item $X[k+N/2] = E[k] - e^{-j2\pi k/N} \cdot O[k]$
                \end{enumerate}
        \end{enumerate}
    \item Return the combined array $X$, which is the FFT of the original sequence.
\end{enumerate}

Where $E[k]$ is the $k$-th element of the FFT of even-indexed elements, and $O[k]$ is the $k$-th element of the FFT of odd-indexed elements.
